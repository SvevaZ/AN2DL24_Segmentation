# Project overview
Second project of the course Artificial Neural Network and Deep Learning, done with the group 8Pesto. The aim was to build from scratch an architecture able to perform segmentation on grayscale 64x128 images, without using fine tuning.
This project was organized as a competition on Kaggle and the two final best models were evaluated using a secret test set.
